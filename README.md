# Information-Visualization




A dataset containing five json files was given and a website, where these databases can be visualized, had to be created. The dataset is composed of: earthquake events, tsunami events, volcano events, volcano locations and helper dataset. All belong to the same database provided by a branch of NOAA, NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information).






An interactive map, where the different disasters can be seen, has been created. A button is placed on top right of the map to change the type of disaster and therefore the map and the title of the map. With this map, we can zoom in and out. Moreover, when the cursor is on a country, the name and the number of disasters appear. There is also a color scale to visualize number disaster occurring in a country.

Two histograms were created to visualize the number of victims and cost of damages. A button is placed on top right of the histogram to change the country and therefore the histogram and the title of the histogram. A slider has been created in order to visualize all the events.
